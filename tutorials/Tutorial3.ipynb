The 'name' field contains the name by which the field will be stored in the system. 'lam' sets the wavelength, 0.01 mm in this case. After that, 'w0x' and 'w0y' set the beamwaist sizes along the x and y-axis in mm, respectively. The refractive index of the medium in which the beam is defined is set by 'n'. The peak electric field value at the focus is set by 'E0'. The astigmatic z-axis distance between the focus of the beam in the x-plane and the y-plane in mm is set by 'dxyz'. Note that, if this option is used, the focus in the x-plane is placed at z=0 and the focus in the y-plane at z=-dxyz. The final field, 'pol', sets the polarisation vector of the Gaussian beam."

If 'device' = 'CPU', 'nThreads' defaults to the total number of CPU threads in your computer. If 'device' = 'GPU', 'nThreads' defaults to 256 threads per CUDA block. In practice, this number is not critical and therefore does not have to be set often, but if set it should be a multiple of 32.\n",

Another option, 'FF' for far-field, will be explained in more detail below. The last option, 'EHP', stores the reflected field and corresponding Poynting vectors. With this option it is possible to do a combined ray-trace and PO approach. This will be introduced in a later tutorial."

We do this by specifying the 'gmode' parameter to be 'AoE', which stands for Azimuth-over-Elevation (the only far-field co-ordinate system currently present in PyPO). The limits in 'AoE' mode are given in degrees. Note that we subtract 90 degrees from the Elevation limits. This is because the paraboloid illuminates the far-field along the x-axis. Also, note that the xyz components of the resulting far-field object do not align with the axes shown in the system plot. This is because, in the resulting fields object, x now aligns with the field along the Azimuthal direction (the y-axis in the original co-ordinate system) and y points along the Elevation direction (the z-axis in the original co-ordinate system).
