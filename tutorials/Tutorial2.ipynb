    "# Tutorial 2: more advanced optical systems and ray-tracing options.\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we built a simple optical system consisting of a paraboloid. We then performed a ray-trace from the initial frame of rays to the paraboloid surface, and from the paraboloid we found the focus of the frame by calling the s.findRTfocus method. We did all of this using the tubular ray-trace frame input.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will introduce Gaussian ray-trace frames. We will then create an optical setup that is slightly more advanced, where we try to generate a collimated beam from a Gaussian ray-trace beam.   "

The semi-major of the ellipsoid is oriented along the z-axis by setting 'orient' to 'z'. \n",

    "The propagations are similar to the one in the previous tutorial, albeit a bit more plentiful. It is good to note that for the propagation from the tilted plane to the paraboloid, we specify the 't0' parameter. This is the initial guess for the ray-tracer. Because we select, in this case, the section from the half of the paraboloid that is furthest away from the tilted plane, the ray-tracer will first encounter the closer half of the paraboloid. This is more easily imagined when we remember that, after transforming the paraboloid and incoming frame into the parabooid restframe, the frame is essentially illuminating the full paraboloid from the side. If we did not change t0, the ray-tracer would instead intersect in the closest half of the paraboloid (to see this, just set t0 to 1 and repeat the propagation).\n",
