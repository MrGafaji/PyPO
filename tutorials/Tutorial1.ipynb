    "We created an empty PyPO system at the end of the previous block. Now, we can define a paraboloid reflector by filling a dictionary with relevant parameters. In this case, we name the paraboloid 'primary'. We choose to generate it using the focus and vertex co-ordinate of the paraboloid by choosing the 'focus' option for the 'pmode' ('parameter mode') field. We choose a 'uv' parametrisation for the 'gmode' ('grid mode') field. This means that, rather than specifying x and y co-ordinates, we define x and y co-ordinates from a polar grid with 'u' being the radius of the circle in x and y, and 'v' being the polar angle. We then set 'flip' to False. This field defines the orientation of the paraboloid surface. The orientation defaults to the positive z-axis, so we keep this unchanged. We then specify vertex and focus co-ordinates. Note that the focus co-ordinate field is called 'focus_1', rather than just 'focus'. Then we define the limits for 'u' and 'v'. Finally we define the gridsizes along the 'u' and 'v' axes. These values are not important for ray-traces but have to be specified nonetheless. For physical optics, as we will see in a later tutorial, these values are critical for a good calculation.\n",
