# Summary

Physical optics (PO) is a high-frequency approximation commonly used for solving
electromagnetic scattering problems [@Balanis:1989]. In this approximation, the electromagnetic field scattered by 
an object is obtained by first integrating the total field illuminating the object across the object to obtain the 
equivalent electric and magnetic currents. 
These currents are then used to calculate the resultant scattered field, which can be either analysed or
propagated to the next object.

This method has been used frequently in fields such as radar engineering and telescope design. It has proven to be an accurate method for high frequency problems, i.e. problems where the diensions of the reflecting surfaces are substantially larger than the wavelength under consideration.

# Statement of need

`PyPO` is a Python interface for end-to-end simulations of general reflector systems using GO/PO.
It offers the following functionality:
 * Convenient workflow for designing and characterising reflector systems consisting of planar and quadric surfaces. Design and simulation can be done in either a simple Python script or through the built-in graphical user interface (GUI).
 * Common beam patterns that can be used as input for GO/PO propagation. Custom beam patterns, for example measured in a lab, can also be used as input.
 * Efficient C/C++/CUDA libraries for performing GO and PO calculations, combining the performance of these compiled languages with the ease-of-use offered by Python.
 * Methods for evaluating common figures of merit such as root-mean-square (RMS) spot values for GO propagation. For PO, commonly used metrics such as spillover, taper, aperture, main beam and cross-polar efficiencies can be calculated.

Commercial software for these ends, such as Zemax and GRASP, has already been developed, but to our knowledge `PyPO` is the first free open-source package that simulates planar and quadric reflectors using both GO and PO. Moreover, `PyPO` does not resort to approximations such as the Fresnel and Fraunhofer approximation commonly used in other software packages. Rather, PyPO directly solves the radiation integral, extending the simulation possibilities.

Currently, `PyPO` is heavily used in the laboratory verification of the DESHIMA 2.0 spectrometer [@Taniguchi:2022] for the alignment procedure and the performance assessment.

# Availability
`PyPO` can be found on [Github](https://github.com/arend95/PyPO). Instructions regarding installation and documentation can be found in the [documentation](https://arend95.github.io/PyPO/). The package comes with several examples illustrating the workflow and features, and can be used as building blocks for new reflector systems.
