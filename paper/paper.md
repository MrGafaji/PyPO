# Summary
`PyPO` is a Python interface for end-to-end design, simulation and analysis of (quasi-)optical reflector systems. 
It can model the forward and backward propagation of electromagnetic field distributions between multiple planar and (off-axis) quadric surfaces, as well as far-field propagations.
Simulations are performed using either geometrical optics (GO) or the equivalent surface current approach, belonging to the field of physical optics (PO) [@Balanis:1989].
The GO and PO calculations are performed using libraries written in C++ and CUDA, allowing for multi-threading and GPU acceleration.
Common figures of merit, such as aperture efficiencies and half-power beamwidths, can be calculated and used for quantitative analysis of the designed system.
Input beam patterns can be selected from a range of models, such as Gaussian beams, point sources and uniform sources. 
Custom beam patterns can also be imported to, for example, model the propagation of a measured beam pattern through a simulated optical system.

`PyPO` can be used through either a scripting-based approach, where simulations are defined in Python scripts, or through the graphical user interface (GUI).
It carries core dependencies on Numpy [@Harris:2020], matplotlib [@Hunter:2007], scipy and nose. The GUI carries an optional dependency on PyQT5.

# Statement of need
Development of `PyPO` started with the need for alignment of the wideband sub-mm spectrometer DESHIMA 2.0 [@Taniguchi:2022]. 
A Python package capable of efficient GO and PO calulations through optical systems consisting of quadric surfaces was necessary for calculating the configuration of the corrective optics. 
Currently, `PyPO` is also being used in simulations of measured beam patterns of DESHIMA 2.0 at the ASTE [@ASTE] telescope for the analysis of instrument performance.

Commercial software for GO and PO calculations, such as OpticStudio (Zemax) and GRASP (TICRA), has already been developed, but to our knowledge `PyPO` is the first free open-source Python package that simulates planar and quadric reflector geometries using both GO and PO. 
Moreover, `PyPO` does not employ approximations often employed by other software packages such as `POPPy` [@Perrin:2012] and Prysm [@Dube:2019]. Rather, PyPO directly solves the radiation integral, allowing for propagation between multiple (off-axis) reflector surfaces.

# Availability
`PyPO` can be found on [Github](https://github.com/arend95/PyPO). 
Software documentation and instructions regarding installation, contribution and issue tracking can be found in the [documentation](https://arend95.github.io/PyPO/). 
The package comes with several tutorials illustrating the workflow and features, and can be used as building blocks for new reflector systems.
