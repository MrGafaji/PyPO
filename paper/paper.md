# Summary

`PyPO` is a Python interface for end-to-end simulations of (quasi-)optical reflector systems. Using `PyPO`, it is possible to simulate electromagnetic field propagation between multiple reflector surfaces. As numerical methods, `PyPO` can use a geometrical optics (GO) approach using ray-tracing, or the equivalent surface current approach, belonging to the field of physical optics (PO) [@Balanis:1989]. 
After propagation of electromagnetic fields, `PyPO` can calculate a multitude of efficiencies and other figures of merit, allowing for quantitative analysis of the designed (quasi-)optical systems.

# Statement of need

`PyPO` offers the following functionality:

- Convenient workflow for designing and characterising reflector systems consisting of planar and quadric surfaces. Design and simulation can be done in either a simple Python script or through the built-in graphical user interface (GUI).
- Common beam patterns, such as point sources and Gaussian beams, that can be used as input for GO/PO propagation. Custom beam patterns, for example measured in a lab, can also be used as input.
- Efficient multi-threaded C++ libraries for performing GO and PO calculations. If an Nvidia GPU is present, the calculations can be accelerated even more using CUDA.
- Methods for evaluating common figures of merit such as root-mean-square (RMS) spot values for GO propagation. For PO, commonly used metrics such as spillover, taper, aperture, main beam and cross-polar efficiencies can be calculated.

Commercial software for these ends, such as OpticStudio (Zemax) and GRASP (TICRA), has already been developed, but to our knowledge `PyPO` is the first free open-source package that simulates planar and quadric reflector geometries using both GO and PO. 
Moreover, `PyPO` does not employ approximations often employed by other software packages such as `POPPy` [@Perrin:2012] and Prysm [@Dube:2019]. Rather, PyPO directly solves the radiation integral, allowing for propagation between multiple reflector surfaces.

Currently, `PyPO` is heavily used in the laboratory verification and characterisation of the DESHIMA 2.0 spectrometer [@Taniguchi:2022]. 
Specifically, `PyPO` is used for the following purposes:

- Optimisation of correcting optics using the GO calculations.
- PO propagation of measured beam patterns through the Cassegrain setup of the ASTE [@ASTE] telescope.
- Calculation of far-field beam patterns after the ASTE telescope.
- Evaluation of the instrument efficiencies at the ASTE telescope.

# Availability
`PyPO` can be found on [Github](https://github.com/arend95/PyPO). 
Software documentation and instructions regarding installation, contribution and issue tracking can be found in the [documentation](https://arend95.github.io/PyPO/). 
The package comes with several worked examples illustrating the workflow and features, which can be used as building blocks for new reflector systems.
